//this program creates an array. An array is a collection of multiple values of the same type.
//arrays are always of fixed length.
//arrays are more useful than vectors if you are sure the number of elements it contains won't change
//e.g. months in a year.

fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let b = [3; 5] //the b array contains five elements, each with a value of three

    let first a[0]; //this creates a variable called first with a value of 1, as 1 occupies the zero index position of the a array
